  description: A famous painting is coming to town today! A friend of mine said that
    bringing a FLASHLIGHT could be useful... If you want to have some more fun, you
    could try to steal the "Golden Fishes" statue. It would look good in my bathroom.
    What? You'd like some more challenge? Then try doing the mission without being
    seen by anyone, just like a ghost. And no cheating with that EMP REMOTE!
